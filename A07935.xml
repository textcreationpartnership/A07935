         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Only I ſay, ſeeing it is moſt certayne, that he dyed Catholike: And ſeeing no learned Man changeth his Religion, but vpon ſome Inducements and Motiues: And laſtly ſeeing in the iudgment of the Publisher heerof, no Motyues are more forcible for a Proteſtant (&amp; perhaps particulerly for the <hi>Bishop</hi>) to change
<pb facs="tcp:3009:4"/>his Religion, and imbrace the Catholike Fayth, then theſe ſet downe in this Treatiſe: Therfore the Publisher, as being warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Xenophon</hi> and others aboue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, wisheth, that Himſelfe may be heere taken to haue written theſe <hi>Motiues,</hi> as a Precedent, or Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </p>
            <p>And therfore to keepe the better <hi>Decorum,</hi> where the <hi>Bishop</hi> in the Epistle Dedicatory, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth the wryting therof to himſelf: VVhere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the Booke it ſelfe, there is ſome enterchange of ſpeeches betweene the <hi>Bishop</hi> and others: And laſtly, where the <hi>Bishop</hi> in the end thereof wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the reſt of the <hi>Bishops</hi> his Brethren: All theſe paſſages, the Reader may (if it pleaſe him) with my full conſent and allowance, ſuppoſe to be <hi>fictiones Perſonarum,</hi> and warranted by the figure <hi>Proſpopcia:</hi> And that the Publisher heerof performeth no more, (if ſo much) then <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> doth in his <hi>Parallels</hi> of the Romans with

            <p>Thus Good Reader, ſeeing matters must be cautelouſly carried in theſe dayes, thou ſeeſt, I will thee not, to take this Treatiſe, as written by the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and deliuered ouer to others in his life tyme, but (in Gods Name) repute it as Myne. For I am not deſirous to father any thing vpon the dead (nor doth the Catholike Cauſe need any ſuch Pretence) but what is acknowledged for ſuch, by the iudgment of all Men; &amp; I know well the B<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. Friends are farre from any ſuch acknowledgment. But howſoeuer, if thou reape profit heerby, I shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be glad; but if neyther the <hi>Bishops</hi> change in Religion, nor theſe preſent <hi>Motyues</hi> (by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer written) can withdraw thee from the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies of theſe tymes, I can but commiſerate the poore and dangerous eſtate of thy Soule.</p>
            <p>If any of the <hi>Bishops</hi> neerest Friends, shall by anſwere impugne this Treatiſe, let him take heed, that the byrth of ſuch a future worke become

And thus (Good Reader) wishing thee to take (at leaſt) in good part, the publishing of this <hi>Legacy,</hi> which indeed had been ſent to the Preſſe inſtantly vpon the <hi>Bishops</hi> death (and ſo had then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately come forth) were it not, that it hath been ſtayed till now, vpon ſome iust and vrgent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I bid thee hartily farewell.</p>

From all theſe teſtimonyes may be inferred, that if the Proteſtants Church was for ſo many ages inuiſible, and that the true fayth and Sacraments thereof were vaniſhed away for ſo long a tyme, then during the length of ſo many ages there were no Doctours to preach the Proteſtants fayth, nor Paſtours to miniſter their Sacramentes; (though the ſame euer to haue beene in the Catholik Church, the Proteſtants forſayd teſtimonyes do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily and implicitely witnes) and conſequently that the aboue alleadged Propheſy, touching the continuance of Paſtours &amp; Doctours in the Church of Chriſt, at all tymes till the end of the world, is not accompliſhed in the Proteſtant Church.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>It is propheſyed of the true Church of Christ, that ſhe muſt conuert heathen Kinges, Kingdomes, and Nations vnto her fayth and Religion: A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The inference I vrge, this I preſſe, in this I make my ſtation: It is drawne from acknowledged Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on all ſides; and from the acknowledged ſenſe of the ſayd Scripture on all ſides.

               <p>And heere I am to certify the Reader, that ſome few teſtimonyes (among many others) of our owne Brethren, alleadged in this treatiſe, I did fynd produced in certaine Catholyke Books; but at the firſt reading of them, I reſted much doubtfull of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3009:32"/>ingenuous, playne, and true alledging of them, till by my owne peruſall of our ſaid Brethrens bookes, I found them moſt ſincerely vrged.

               <p>Concerning the firſt, it is not ſufficient for our Brethren (vnder their reducing of the matter to the ſcripture interpreted by the <hi>priuate Spirit</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but an idle circulation and maze of diſpute) to affirme, that the Catholykes haue departed from the auncient fayth firſt inſtituted by Chriſt, except withall they ſhow ſome certaine Community of Chriſtians, more auncient then the Catholyks, from whome they departed; the Catholiques by by this meanes taking vpon them a certaine name of the firſt ſtampers of their doctryne (as the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> the <hi>Iouinians,</hi> and all others haue done) or from the doctryne it ſelfe.

And thus though <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> neuer wrought any miracle, yet God vouchſafed to exhibite this miracle for his greater confuſion: So as thoſe wordes of <hi>Tertullian</hi> may well be heere verifyed: <hi>Apostoli</hi>

               <p>Now, what can we iuſtly reply, or oppoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Miracles wrought by the members of the Catholyke Church? To deny the working of all ſuch Miracles, were to denye all Eccleſiaſticall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords &amp; teſtimonyes, and indeed to take away by the ſame ground all authority of hiſtory, either ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall or prophane. Therefore if we will but aſcry be as much credit to the wrytings of <hi>Zozomene. Auguſtin, Ierome Chryſoſtom, Theodoret, Euſebius,</hi> &amp; others of thoſe primitiue tymes, recording the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acles of their dayes; as we commonly giue to the Commentaries of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or to the <hi>Lyues of Liuy,</hi> or any other auncient prophane Authentical Authour, we muſt be forced to acknowledge, that ſuch mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were really wrought, and no forged lyes. Againe touching the particuler miracles of <hi>Sichem</hi> (diuulged by <hi>Lipſius,</hi> as is ſaid,) it is knowne, that in <hi>Brahant,</hi> and all other Prouinces now vnder the Archduke, neare adioyning to <hi>Sichem,</hi> there are many Proteſtants at this day; how chanceth it then, that amonge ſo many Miracles there ſaid to be done, no one Proteſtant would take exception againſt any one of them, as not done at all, or otherwyſe but effected by confederacy of partyes, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite?

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſaid truths to be beleiued: So as no true ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall fayth can be produced but where theſe two concurre. The firſt of theſe is called by the Deuines: <hi>Obiectum formale</hi> of fayth; the ſecond, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſſis, Regula,</hi> or the <hi>Propounder</hi> of the articles of fayth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:3009:50"/>Now from hence it proceedeth, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer denyeth any one Truth, propounded by the Church (to whom God reuealeth it) doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue any other Article with a true fayth; Since the authority of the Church doth indifferently and alyke propound all Articles to be beleiued; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who beleiueth the Article of the Trinity, or the Reſurrection of the body, through the Authority of the Church, propounding them to be beleiued; will alſo beleiue Freewill, Prayer to Saints &amp;c. and any other poynt; ſeeing theſe are no leſſe propounded by the Church to be beleiued, as reuealed by God, then the former are. Thus it is euident, that who beleiueth one article of true Chriſtian fayth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiueth not another; this Man beleiueth not any one article, by reaſon of the authority of Gods Church (and conſequently, hath no true ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall fayth at all, which is auaileable to Saluation) but beleiueth it, in regard only of the probability of the point in his Iudgment; and thus it is not Beleife, but Opinion only in ſuch a Man. For ſeeing the ſame credit and affiance is euer to be giuen in all things, to the ſame authority; whoſoeuer doth not beleiue the ſaid authority in any one poynt, doth not (as is ſaid) beleiue it in any other; from whence it followeth, that the authority of God &amp; his Church is equally contemned in the denyall of the ſmalleſt articles, as of praying to Saints, Purgatory &amp;c. as in the greateſt articles of the Trinity, Incarnation, or any other ſublime and high myſtery.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon: It is peculiar to Vertues
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3009:50"/>Theologicall, and Infuſed, to be obliterated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by one only contrary Act. Thus for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, one mortall Sinne wholy taketh away Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Grace; One act of deſperation the vertue of Hope; the ſame may be exemplifyed in the vertues of Pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nance, Religion, and others. Now heere by the ſame reaſon I inferre, that one Hereſy (I meane an obſtinate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayning of any one errour in fayth, how ſmall ſoeuer, againſt the authority of Gods Church) depriueth a man of true fayth, which (as other Vertues aboue are) is ſupernaturall, theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and infuſed.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3009:55"/>man (much more, the Saints and Angells) may be (without any indignity to our Sauiour) one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſince no prayers (euen by the Catholiks owne doctrine) are auailable, but ſuch, as are founded in the beliefe in Chriſt, and in the vertue and force of his moſt deare and precious Paſſion: So willfully we miſtake the doctrine of the Church of Rome heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Indulgences,</hi> How frequent are theſe and the like bold reproaches with vs? That the Paprſts teach, the Pope can giue aforehand pardon for any ſubiect to murther his King; that he can ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue one from the ſinne, which heere after he is to comnit. What fooleryes are theſe? And how idly do we diuer berate the ayre in deliuering in our Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſuch improbable or rather ſenſeles aſſertions; they being indeed incompatible with common Reaſon? Do not the Catholikes owne bookes ſhow; firſt, that the Pope can no more forgiue aforhand any one ſinne, which heerafter is to be perpetrated, then he can create a new world; ſince the obiect of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Pennance is a ſinne already committed? Secondly, that the Pope cannot remit the guilt of ſinne (I meane the puniſhment of damnation due to ſinne) by meanes of any Indulgences; for it is their owne generall doctrine, that no man can be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of any Indulgence, but at the tyme of his recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thereof, he muſt be in ſtate of grace, to which ſtate he is firſt brought by vertue of a ſacramentall Confeſſion, or (when that cannot be obtained) by force of a true and perfect Contrition? Thirdly and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3009:56"/>laſtly, that the guilt of eternall damnation being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remitted (as is ſayd) by the ſacrament of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, or (in want thereof) by perfect Contrition, there remaines a temporal puniſhment for the ſayd ſinnes afore remitted, for the ſatisfying of Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; which temporall puniſhment (as being the only obiect of Indulgences) the Catholikes hould, the Pope as Chriſts Vicar heere vpon earth, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſer of his ſpirituall Treaſure, can either-leſſen or wholy take away (if ſo the party be capable thereof, in being at that inſtant in ſtate of Grace, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the pennances enioyned vpon him) by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying vnto him vpon iuſt occaſions the ſuperbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of Chriſts paſſion. In whoſe paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the more fully ſatisfying of all eternall (much more tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall) puniſhment, the ſheeding of one drop of bloud was ſufficient to redeeme thouſands of Worlds; ſince then (his Humanity being accompanyed with the Diuinity) Innocency did ſuffer for ſinne, Iuſtice for offence, Health for infirmity, and finally God for Man.

               <p>Finally, do we not diuulge, that the Pope, and his Church aduance themſelus aboue the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, allowing for Scripture that, which is not; and altering at their pleaſure the true ſenſe of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by obtruding vpon it, any ſenſe of their owne.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3009:57"/>The Pope and the Church thus far proceed: They declare only, what bookes be Scripture, or not Scripture, among many <hi>Apochriphal</hi> writings; and which conſtruction of true Scripture (among many ſuggeſted ſenſes thereof) is the intended meaning of the Holy Ghoſt. Thus they neither make nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make Scripture, nor impoſe any ſenſe vpon it, which afore it had not, but only declare, which afore it had. And thus by this meanes, they aſſume no more to themſelues, then any priuate Proteſtant practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by the help of his <hi>reuealing ſpirit.</hi> But what? Muſt it needes be inferred, that the Pope, and the Church for ſuch their proceeding, ſeeke to be aboue the Scripture? Then may it be alike concluded that the Iudge is aboue the Law, ſince he expreſſeth, what is Law, and which is the true meaning of the Law-giuer therein. All that hence may be truely deduced, is this, viz. That the Pope and the Church is not aboue Scripture (which with all reuerence they affect) but aboue the Iudgments of priuate men expounding the Scripture.</p>
               <p>But heere (to make an end of the Catholiks miſtaken doctrines) I cannot, but call to mind, how I was ſeueral tyms accuſtomed to charge the Prieſts, and others of their Religion appearing before me, with the defence of the former abſurdityes (though I confeſſe, I did then well know, what their learned men did hold therein:) And I do aſſure the Reader, that the Prieſtes, being expoſtulated heereof, did ſeeme halfe amazed at theſe my ſtrange demandes. Yea one of the Prieſtes (a bold and reſolute man)
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3009:57"/>thus anſwered me: <hi>My Lord, if you demand of me and others in earneſt, whether theſe ſenſeles poſitions be our do Irines, it ſeemes, you know not, what the Catholik Church teacheth heerein; and then it is strang, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty ſhould place you in ſeate of iudgment against vs, to puniſh vs for that Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, your ſelfe not knowing the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which the ſayd religion teacheth.</hi> An anſwere blunt and without reſpect, yet not much to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked, ſince it is a wronge to truth, to be outfaced and depreſſed with calumnyes.</p>
               <p>Towards the <hi>Auncient Fathers</hi> we haue ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall peculiar deportments; firſt we ſtryue to breake through their authorityes with ſleighty euaſions; this fayling, next to breake downe their authorityes by open diſclayminges.</p>
               <p>Thus in the former manner we proceed diuers wayes. Firſt, when any place of a Father is obiected againſt vs, we endeauour (ſo loath we are to make an abſolut departure from them, if poſſibly it could be auoyded) to interprete the Fathers words in ſome other ſenſe, then they are vrged by our Aduerſaryes or intended by the Fathers.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3009:70"/>My ſelf haue much marked this alteration, and one example I cannot without wronge paſſe ouer: It is this. One yeare in my Vice chancelouriſhip in <hi>Oxford</hi> (my deare mother, from whoſe breſtes, I haue ſucked my beſt milke) there was a Mayſter of Arts, a man of reaſonable yeares; in iudgment a moſt forward and earneſt Proteſtant; of a delicate and choyce wit; good literature; a great ſpirit; but extremely diſſolute, and looſe in manners, as wholy giuen ouer to Senſuality. I wiſhed him well for his good partes (though his tares did ouergrow his wheat) and for his friends behalfe. My many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions for his change of lyfe, was but as ſeede ſowne in a barren ground; in ſo much, as I was forced otherwyſe to chaſtize him for his publike diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. This Man leauing <hi>Oxford,</hi> trauelled beyond the Seas; there ſtayed ſome yeares; altered his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Religion; renewed his ſtudyes; was made Prieſt; returned into England; was apprehended, and conuented before me, then B. of London At the firſt ſight I remembred well the Man, and he me.

I talked with him in priuate: He denyed not his Prieſthood: I vrged him, that his former bad Courſe of lyfe ſerued, as a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his now worſe ſtate. I profered him (if ſo h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at my touching of his lyfe, he guſhed out into abundance of teares, fully acknoledging his former enormous courſes; and his teares ceaſing, thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: My Lord, (for this was his anſwere) it is to be feared, that I may ſay with ſome <hi>Ancients: perijſſem ſi non perijſſem,</hi> ſince the reflecting vpon the deformity and vglines of my owne former wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked courſes, was occaſionally a meanes for my change of Religion, and my incorporating into Gods Church, through his infinite mercy, who worketh good out of euill, as <hi>once he</hi>

But touching my motioning his reuolt in his fayth, his reply was, that if he had as many lyues, as there are ſtars in Heauen (a ſupernaturall and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reſolution) he would loſe them all, before he would change his religion. I enquyred of his cariage in priſon, and I was informed, that, beſides the affliction of the place (which might ſeeme ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent) he vſed diuers voluntary auſterityes. The end was, I not preuayling with him in my deſyres, did haſten his baniſhement. But obſeruing his different
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3009:71"/>comportmentes at theſe two different tymes, how often thought I (for then I made no other conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though I graunt, ſince I haue giuen it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Comment) muſt it be the miſhap of the Goſpell of Chriſt, and the aduantage of Superſtition, that a Man profeſſing the true ſayth, muſt engulfe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in all wickednes; and after comming from the light into the darknes of Errour, muſt inſtantly breath penitency of former ſinnes, humility, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſanctity of lyfe? But inough of this Man.</p>
               <p>As concerning other Prieſts in generall, my experience taken from their often appearance and conuiction before me, aſſureth my iudgment, that (abſtracting from the Lawes of the Realme) they are good Men, greatly deuoted to vertue and piety, labouring (with expoſall of their liues to imminent danger) to ſaue ſeduced Soules. And indeed it is aboue the leuell of Nature, to ſee moſt of them, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen by byrth, of liberall education, hauing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe competency of meanes (yea ſome heyres to their parents whole Patrimony and ſtate) thus to ſhake hands with the world, and all the pleaſures thereof (ſo bearing a ſpirituall death, in a naturall lyfe) and ready only for the good of other ſoules, to become ſo many yonge <hi>Iſaacs,</hi> expecting to be made ſacrifices, if the <hi>Angell</hi> of mercy ſtay not the hand of the Law. Thus where ſome two or three of them (among many ſcores) through a baſe reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting puſillanimity (commonly vſhered afore with a ſecret vitious courſe) are glad to purchaſe an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble

That all true Reaſon perſwadeth me to implant and ingraft my ſelf in that Church, which I fynd to be acknowledged, for the true church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Saluation to her members, euen by her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaryes. For if I dye Catholyke (my lyfe being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable thereto) both Catholyks and Proteſtants warrant my Saluation; But dying in the fayth of Proteſtancy, the Proteſtant alone (and this in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their owne Religion) aſſure me of it For there is neuer a learned Catholyke wryter in the world (an obſeruation much to be weighed) who granteth, that a Proteſtant dying with a poſitiue, ſetled, and contumacious neglect of the Catholyke Church and fayth, can be ſaued. This then being thus, ſhall I in ſo great a buſines leaue a certainty for vncertainty? God forbid. We Proteſtants expect to be beleiued in other our Poſitions and doctrynes;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:3009:90"/>Why not then in this? Since then the Proteſtants do teach, that Catholyks (ſo dying) are in ſtate of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation, I am reſolued, my Brethrens wrytings ſhall haue that powerfull influence ouer me, as what the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, doe heerin teach, I will (through Gods grace) put in execution. And ſo my Will ſhall become in this poynt, a ready and ſeruiceable Handmayd to their Iudgments.</p>
               <p>The ſecond. The Wronge, which we Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants commit, in afflicting the Catholyks, and in vnnaturally betrampling vpon their deiected eſtats, only for matters of Religion. Alas! by our owne doctryne, they are neither <hi>Babylonians,</hi> nor <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> both they and we being (as we teach) <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lits;</hi> why then ſhould <hi>Iſrael</hi> thus perſecute <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Are we not become the gaze of Chriſtendome, thus to fight without an enemy? Thus for kynred to wound it owne kyndred, yea often the Father the Sonne? ſo turning our owne ſwords into our owne childrens breaſts; we ſtill inciting his Maieſty to greater ſeuerity (a Prince of his owne diſpoſition, of the moſt benigne, mercifull, and commiſerating nature, that the World at this day enioyes) and all this for the Catholyks liuing in that fayth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in which our ſelues teach, they may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; thus do we make the confeſſed hope of their ſaluation, to be the ſole cauſe of their preſſures and calamityes.
